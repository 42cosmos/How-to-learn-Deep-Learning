### My Approach 

I'll take a practical, top-down approach, starting with high-level frameworks with a focus on Deep Learning. I'll start with csv files, then work with images, text, sound, videos and then games. I'll work on increasingly difficult problems, beginning with test problems with clean datasets and the move towards real-world problems. 

I started with Andrew Ng’s Course, but I lost motivation fairly soon. Juggling a new programming language, heavy math, and combining it with complex programming concepts was too much for me.

My next stop was Kaggle campion Jeremy Howard’s fast AI course. A practical deep learning course starting with high level concepts. This has become a rough roadmap for me, but I still fall in the copy paste trap. I grew an increased familiarity with the concepts, but I couldn’t apply DL from scratch.

Tutorials are great at explaining concepts and for installing software, but they are not ideal to learn from. They are often created with the mindset of teaching you something. Instead of focusing on explanations this tutorial cuts out what is necessary for you to start learning. 

I'll start by learning the basic [Python syntax with Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and [Google's Hello World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw) and youtube series to learn [Scikit learn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd0flgGphKCej-9jp-QdzZ3). I'll start with the beginner [problems on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words), then do real world problems on their platform and then do a few request for [research projects on OpenAI](https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#im2latex). While doing real problems, I'll try [Udacity's intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120), [Fast AI's course](http://course.fast.ai/index.html), [Colombia's course](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-columbiax-csmm-102x-0), and [Stanford's course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This approach is inspired by [this medium article](https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/machine-learning-in-a-year-cdb0b0ebd29c) and [this quora post.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-pick-up-Deep-Learning-skills-as-an-engineer)
