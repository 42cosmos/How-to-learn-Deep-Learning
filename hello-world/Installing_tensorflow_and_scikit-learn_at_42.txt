1. Make sure your brew works, this worked for me: https://github.com/kube/42homebrew
2. brew install python3
3. pip3 install tensorflow --user
4. pip3 install scipy --user
5. pip3 install scikit-learn --user
6. Create a document, hello-world.py, and include import sklearn and 
import tensorflow. 
7. python3 hello-world.py (if you don't get any errors, it's working)
8. Try the frameworks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw
